The values of a **map** class are iterated when being called by the property **`.values()`**. Value is found within the map class. When called, matching values are returned in the form of a list. The length of the matching values should be as long as the amount of key/value pairs in the searched map. The data values being iterated are compared in  ==; therefore it's not a strict-equals comparison.


## Syntax
```
variable <V> get values;
```
Where V stands for the map class used to get is values using the .values() property
